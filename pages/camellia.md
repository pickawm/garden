## Camellia Room

‘Leila’ Camellia (Catherine Cathcart)

This flowering bush was easily one of the most important plants in Eudora Welty’s life. Camellias were her favorite flower, but Leila always had a special place in her heart.

‘Leila’ was given to Welty by John Robinson, with whom she had a romantic relationship at the time. Robinson served as an airman in World War II and Welty doted over ‘Leila’ in his absence. In letters to him she reported on its progress, how much it had grown, how well it was flowering, and how many new leaves it had since her last report.

In a 1943 letter, Welty wrote that her ‘Leila’ was “superbly decked in buds, the finest any camellia has, long and full and pointed.” (Tell About Night Flowers 100). She repeatedly found that ‘Leila’ outperformed the other camellias in her garden. In 1944, after a remarkable camellia season, she dreamed that ‘Leila’ was “the Mozart of camellias” (Tell About Night Flowers 120-121.)

‘Chandlerii Elegans’ Camellia

This camellia features in Welty’s Pulitzer prize winning novel, The Optimist’s Daughter as the favorite flower of main character Laurel’s late father. Chestina Welty reports planting the bush while it was raining in her garden diary on February 19, 1937.

White Empress Camellia

This camellia, like many in the Welty Garden, has been growing since the 1940’s. It is thought that this is the flower Welty was describing when she told Diarmuid Russell that she had a white camellia so bright she could read by it at night.
