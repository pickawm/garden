## About the Collection

About  

The stories of Eudora Welty are host to a unique cast of characters and landscapes. In each of her stories, there is something for each reader to relate to, whether it be a strong sense of place like in “June Recital,” the feeling of nostalgia as in “A Memory,” or the complex emotions which she explores in “The Winds.”  

Welty partially attributed the success of these stories to her attention to detail. Her example of this stems from the early days of her writing career when critic Herschel Brickell told her to “Always be sure you get your moon in the right part of the sky” (One Writer’s Beginnings 848.) Of course, the same goes for other details of nature. For Welty, plant and flower life was always part of setting the place of a story. Her mother, Chestina Welty, was an avid gardener and had plotted her landscape so that in her garden there would always be something in bloom. Thus, Eudora’s understanding of the changing of seasons and time is often demonstrated in her work through the presence of various blooms. For her, each plant stands as symbol of place and emotion as well, just as the “Becky’s Climber” rose does in her novel The Optimist’s Daughter.  

Because of the intimate relationship between Welty’s writing and gardening, knowledge of the plants which she lived with and cared for invites a richer understanding of the texts she created. Furthermore, most of the plants mentioned by name in her work are those which she herself tended in her backyard, many of which still thrive at the restored Eudora Welty House and Garden today.  

While the gap between nature and technology may seem to be wide in today’s world, we believe that we can use the gift of technology to spread knowledge about the importance of plant life and its effect on literature. It is our mission to make Welty’s garden and her writing accessible to the twenty-first century reader.
